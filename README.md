# DataEngineering
## Data engineering concepts

Data engineer lays the groundwork that makes data science activity possible.
A data engineers responsibility includes:
  1. Ingest data from different sources.
  2. Optimize database for analysis
  3. Remove corrupted data
  4. Develop, construct, test and maintain data architectures

With above responsibility data Engineers deliver:
  1. the correct data
  2. in the right form
  3. to the right people
  4. as efficiently as possible
  
Data engineers are not responsible for building visualization to see pattern in data or building predictive models.  
  
Data Workflow:
  1. Data collection and storage (Data enginner)
  2. Data preparation
  3. Exploration and Visualization
  4. Experimentation and prediction
  
With BigData becoming the norm, more and more data enginners are needed.
With big data you have to think how to deal with data size as traditional methods fails in doing so.

Bigdata mainly include sensor/device data, social media data, enterprise data, VoIP data.
Below are five V's of big data:
  1. Volumne ( How much?)
  2. Variety (what kind?)
  3. Velocity (how frequent?)
  4. Veracity (how accurate?)
  5. Value (how useful?)
  
  How Data Engineers enable data scientists?
          Data Engineer             Data Scientist
    Ingest and store data             Exploit data
    Set up databases                  Access database
    Build data pipelines             Use data pipeline output
    Strong software skill             Strong analytical skill
